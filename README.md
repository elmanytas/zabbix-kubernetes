# zabbix for kubernetes

Zabbix is a monitoring system that allows to do traditional checks, protocol checks and functional application checks easily.

## helm chart

Zabbix images are available and provided by zabbix but there is not any official chart that deploys them in kubernetes.

You can use the chart in zabbix-server-mysql to deploy it.
